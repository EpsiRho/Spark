# Spark
✨A simple, modern Minecraft server manager✨

## What is this?
Spark is an application that can help you manage multiple local servers for Minecraft. It also provides a simple, modern UI that makes it easy for anyone to get a server up and running!

It's built in XAML / C# on the **Windows App SDK** with WinUI 3. It's currently an Unpackaged application, but may have Packaged / Microsoft Store variants after initial release.

## Why?
Like everything else I make, I made it because it was something I needed. If you needed something like this too, then that's just a bonus.

The goal is to make managing and running a Minecraft server fast, easy, and simple. This means making the application easy to navigate and filled with hints to help users understand what does what. 

## Features
